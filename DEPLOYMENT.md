# Vercel Deployment Guide - Fixed MIME Type Issues

## Your Issue: White Screen + MIME Type Errors

### ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**
The white screen and MIME type errors have been fixed with the following changes:

1. **Updated `vercel.json`** - Now properly handles static assets before routing
2. **Updated `vite.config.js`** - Better asset file naming and structure
3. **Added `public/_redirects`** - Alternative routing fallback
4. **Fixed `index.html`** - Added `crossorigin` attribute for module scripts

### The Problem
Your app was getting HTML responses for JavaScript module requests because Vercel was treating all requests (including JS files) as routes and returning `index.html`.

### The Fix
The new `vercel.json` configuration:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures that:
1. Static files (JS, CSS, assets) are served directly from the filesystem
2. Only non-file requests get routed to `index.html`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel MIME type errors and routing"
git push
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
- If connected to GitHub: Vercel will auto-deploy
- Manual: Go to Vercel dashboard → Your project → Deployments → Redeploy

### 3. Test Your Deployment
- Visit your Vercel URL
- Test direct navigation to routes like `/explore`, `/popular`
- Refresh pages to ensure no 404 errors
- Check browser console for any remaining errors

### 4. If Still Having Issues
Run these commands locally to debug:
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Complete Fix Summary

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ **`vercel.json`** - Fixed routing and static asset handling
2. ✅ **`vite.config.js`** - Improved build configuration
3. ✅ **`public/_redirects`** - Alternative routing fallback
4. ✅ **`index.html`** - Added crossorigin for module scripts
5. ✅ **`package.json`** - Added Vercel-specific scripts

### What Was Fixed:
- ❌ **White screen issue**
- ❌ **MIME type errors for JS modules**
- ❌ **404 errors on page refresh**
- ❌ **Client-side routing problems**
- ❌ **CORS errors with MangaDx API**

### Additional CORS Solution:
- ✅ **API Proxy**: Added `/api/mangadx/[...path].js` to proxy MangaDx requests
- ✅ **Environment Detection**: Auto-switches between direct and proxy API calls
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better logging and timeout management

### Performance Improvements:
- ✅ Code splitting for vendor and UI libraries
- ✅ Proper asset caching headers
- ✅ Optimized build output

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 404 on Page Refresh
✅ **Fixed**: `vercel.json` file handles client-side routing

### Build Errors
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run lint`
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check build locally: `npm run build`

### API Issues
- Ensure MangaDx API is accessible from production
- Check CORS settings if using custom APIs
- Monitor network requests in browser dev tools

### Performance Issues
- Images are automatically optimized by Vercel
- Code splitting is configured in `vite.config.js`
- Static assets are cached by Vercel CDN

## Monitoring
- Check deployment logs in Vercel dashboard
- Use browser dev tools to debug client-side issues
- Monitor API rate limits and response times

## Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed by Vercel
