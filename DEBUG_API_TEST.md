# API Debug Information

## Error Analysis
The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'b0b721ff-c388-4486-aa0f-c2b0bb321512')` indicates that:

1. **The manga ID**: `b0b721ff-c388-4486-aa0f-c2b0bb321512` 
2. **The problem**: Trying to access `undefined[mangaId]` 
3. **Root cause**: The statistics API response is `undefined` or doesn't have the expected structure

## Debugging Steps Added

### 1. Enhanced Logging in `fetchStatisticsBatch`
- Logs the request parameters being sent
- Logs the full response received
- Logs specific error details

### 2. Enhanced Logging in `MangaPostSection`
- Logs how many manga are being fetched
- Logs the statistics response structure
- Logs individual manga statistics
- Safer object access with type checking

## Potential Issues

### A. Vercel Rewrite Not Working
If the rewrite in vercel.json isn't working:
- API calls to `/api/...` aren't being proxied to `https://api.mangadx.org/...`
- This would cause CORS errors or 404s

### B. MangaDx API Changes
If the MangaDx API structure changed:
- The statistics endpoint might return different structure
- Field names might have changed

### C. Rate Limiting
If we're hitting rate limits:
- API might return empty responses
- Could cause undefined data structures

## Next Steps
1. Deploy with enhanced logging
2. Check browser console for detailed logs
3. Verify network requests are going to correct URLs
4. Check if statistics API endpoint structure has changed

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test if the rewrite is working (should show MangaDx API response)
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/manga?limit=1

# Test statistics API specifically
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/statistics/manga?manga[]=b0b721ff-c388-4486-aa0f-c2b0bb321512
